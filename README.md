<img src="./task_image.png"  width="40%" height="40%">

This repository serves as a comprehensive guide documenting the successful resolution of a challenging technical task assignment, encompassing aspects such as design, technical writing, networking knowledge, and cloud architecture.

## Main Goals:

1. **Code - API Application on AWS:**
   - Develop and implement an API application on the AWS platform.
   - The entire process of planning, implementing, and deploying the company's API service using ECS and CloudFront is outlined.
   - Explore the detailed solution in the [Task 1 directory](./Task1/) and refer to the accompanying [document](./Task1/README.md) for an in-depth understanding, including the related code.

2. **Design Document - High-Level System Architecture:**
   - Generate a High-Level Design (HLD) document for suggested system architecture.
   - This section provides a detailed outline of the HLD document, complete with schematics defining information flow and describing technical solutions to achieve the specified objectives.
   - Delve into the HLD document by reviewing the content in the [README document](./Task2/README.md).

By navigating through the provided resources, you will gain valuable insights into the thought process, methodologies, and technical intricacies involved in successfully addressing the assigned tasks. 
This documentation is designed to serve as a reference for both the implemented code and the overarching system architecture.
